# rvos
RISC-V emulator and minimal "OS". Loads and runs .elf files on Linux and Windows.

    usage: rvos <elf_executable>

    arguments:    -e     just show information about the elf executable; don't actually run it
                  -g     (internal) generate rcvtable.txt
                  -h:X   # of meg for the heap (brk space) 0..1024 are valid. default is 1
                  -i     if -t is set, also enables risc-v instruction tracing
                  -p     shows performance information at app exit
                  -t     enable debug tracing to rvos.log

Notes:

    This is a simplistic 64-bit RISC-V emulator.
    Only physical memory is supported.
    Only a subset of instructions are implemented (enough to to run my test apps).
    Compressed rvc 16-bit instructions are supported, though apps run about 5% slower.
    Float instructions are implemented; double are not.
    I tested with a variety of C and C++ apps compiled with g++. 
    Some of the Gnu C Runtime is tested -- memory, fopen/open families of IO, printf/sprintf.
    I also tested with the BASIC test suite for my compiler BA, which targets risc-v.
    It's slightly faster than the 400Mhz K210 physical processor when emulated on my AMD 5950x machine.
    The tests folder has test apps written in C.
    rvos can run rvos on both Windows and Linux; the emulator is good enough to emulate itself.

ttt_riscv.s is a sample app. This requires rvos_shell.s, which has _start and a function to print text to the console
that apps can call. I used the SiPeed Maixduino Arduino Gnu tools for the K210 RISC-V machine. The shell is slightly
different on the actual hardware -- it calls bamain (not main) and the text print function prints to the device's LCD.

    make_s.bat:     test app build script. compiles and links ttt_riscv.s and riscv_shell.s to make ttt_riscv.elf
    ttt_riscv.s:    app to prove you can't win a nuclear war per War Games
    rvos_shell.s:   wrapper for the app (defines _start and rvos ABI)
    minimal.ino:    Arduino IDE equivalent C++ app for riscv_shell.s on the K210 hardware

    words.txt       Used by tests\an.c test app to generate anagrams 

The tests folder has a number of small C/C++ programs that can be compiled using mariscv.bat. The .elf files produced
can be run by rvos. If the app will use more 1 meg of RAM for the heap, uses rvos' /h argument to specify how much
RAM to allocate. The anagram generater an can use up to 30MB in some cases.

RVOS has a few simple checks for memory references outside of bounds. When detected it shows some stat and exits.
For example:

    rvos fatal error: memory reference prior to address space: 200
    pc: 80000002 main
    address space 80000000 to 801105c0

        tp:                0,   t0:                0,   t1:                0,   t2:                0,

        s8:                0,   s9:                0,  s10:                0,  s11:                0,

Tracing with the -t and -i flags shows execution information including function names and registers. 
For example, tcrash.elf is an app that makes an illegal access to memory. It was used for the crash 
dump above. 

    extern "C" int main()
    {
        char * pbad = (char *) 0x200;
        *pbad = 10;
    } //main
