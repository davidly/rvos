# rvos
Loads and runs Linux RISC-V .elf files on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

    usage: rvos <elf_executable>

    arguments:    -e     just show information about the elf executable; don't actually run it
                  -g     (internal) generate rcvtable.txt
                  -h:X   # of meg for the heap (brk space) 0..1024 are valid. default is 1
                  -i     if -t is set, also enables risc-v instruction tracing
                  -p     shows performance information at app exit
                  -t     enable debug tracing to rvos.log

* Notes:
    * This is a simplistic 64-bit RISC-V M Mode emulator; it's an AEE (Application Execution Environment) that exposes a Linux-like ABI.
    * Only physical memory is supported.
    * Compressed rvc 16-bit instructions are supported, though apps run about 5% slower.
    * Float and double instructions are implemented.
    * Atomic and fence instructions are implemented assuming there is just one core.
    * Much of the Gnu C Runtime is tested -- memory, fopen/open families of IO, printf/sprintf, math, etc.
    * I also tested with the BASIC test suite for my compiler BA, which targets RISC-V.
    * The emulator is faster than the 400Mhz K210 physical processor when run on an AMD 5950x.
    * The tests folder has test apps written in C. These build with both old and new g++ for RISC-V.
    * rvos can run rvos on Windows, MacOS, and Linux; the emulator can emulate itself nested arbitrarily deeply (slowly).
    * Linux system call emulation isn't great. It's just good enough to test RISC-V emulation.
    * Build for MacOS using the Linux build scripts (m.sh, etc.)
    * rvos only runs static-linked RISC-V .elf files. Use the -static flag with ld.
    * Gnu CC torture execution tests were run on the emulator.

Both the  old g++ compiler that targets the RISC-V SiPeed K210 hardware and the latest 
https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain targeting Linux for RISC-V are supported. 
They each use different C runtimes and call into Linux syscalls differently. RVOS built with
riscv-gnu-toolchain for RISC-V can run itself nested as well as rvos built with the older toolchain.

* Files:
    * riscv.?xx       Emulates a RISC-V processor in M mode.
    * rvos.cxx        Loads .elf files and executes them using the riscv.?xx emulator. Emulates some Linux syscalls.
    * rvos.h          Header file for rvos and for apps that call into rvos syscalls
    * rvctable.txt    RVC compressed to 16-bit RISC-V instruction lookup table. Generated by rvos -g
    * m.bat           Builds rvos on Windows. mr.bat is the same but release-optimized
    * m.sh            Builds rvos on Linux. mr.sh is the same but is release-optimized.
    * mt.sh           Builds test .c apps on Linux
    * mrvoself.sh     Builds rvos.elf so it can be run in an rvos emulator on Linux
    * marm64.bat      Builds rvos on Arm64 Windows
    * mrvos.bat       Builds rvos.elf targeting a RISC-V Linux machine, which rvos can execute.
    * mrvoself.sh     Builds rvos.elf targeting a RISC-V Linux machine, which rvos can execute.
    * rt.bat          Runs tests in the test folder, assuming they're built
    * rt.sh           Runs tests on Linux
    * baseline_test_rvos.txt  Expected output of rt.bat, rt.sh, rti.bat, rti.sh, etc.
    * kendryte.ld     Gnu ld configuration file to target SiPeed K210 RISC-V hardware and RVOS
    * djltrace.hxx    debug tracing class
    * words.txt       Used by tests\an.c test app to generate anagrams 

The tests folder has a number of small C/C++ programs that can be compiled using mariscv.bat on Windows or
mt.sh on Linux. The .elf files produced can be run by rvos. If the app will use more 1 meg of RAM for the 
heap, use rvos' /h argument to specify how much RAM to allocate. The anagram generater an can use up to 
30MB in some cases. These build with both the old and new G++ compilers.

* Test files:
    * an.c        Anagram generator
    * ba.c        Simple basic interpreter and compiler (can target RISC-V, 6502, 8080, 8086, x86, amd64, arm32, arm64)
    * e.c         Computes e
    * mysort.c    Sorts a text input file and produces a text output file
    * sieve.c     Finds prime numbers
    * t.c         Tests integers of various sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
    * tap.c       Computes Ap√©ry's number
    * tcrash.c    Tests out of bounds memory, pc, and sp references
    * td.c        Tests doubles
    * tdir.c      Tests directory function (only works with the newer g++ tools)
    * tenv.c      Tests using C environment functions
    * tf.c        Tests floating point numbers
    * tfile.c     Tests file I/O
    * tphi.c      Computes phi
    * ts.c        Tests bit shifts on various integer types
    * ttime.c     Tests retrieving and showing the current time
    * ttt.c       Proves you can't win at tic-tac-toe
    
To run the rvos emulator in the rvos emulator, on Linux/MacOS/Windows issue a command like:

    rvos /h:60 rvos.elf /h:40 an phoebe bridgers
    
That gives the inner emulator 60 megs of RAM so it can give 40 megs to the AN anagram generator (an.c in the 
tests folder) so it can find the 485 3-word anagrams for that text including bog bride herpes. Running the emulator
in the emulator makes it aout 100x slower.

ttt_riscv.s is a sample assembler app. This requires rvos_shell.s, which has _start and a function to print text to the console
that apps can call. I used the SiPeed Maixduino Arduino Gnu tools for the K210 RISC-V machine. The shell is slightly
different on the actual hardware -- it calls bamain (not main) and the text print function prints to the device's LCD.

* Sample assembler files:
    * make_s.bat:     test app build script. compiles and links ttt_riscv.s and riscv_shell.s to make ttt_riscv.elf
    * ttt_riscv.s:    app to prove you can't win a nuclear war per War Games
    * rvos_shell.s:   wrapper for the app (defines _start and rvos ABI)
    * minimal.ino:    Arduino IDE equivalent C++ app for riscv_shell.s on the K210 hardware

RVOS has a few simple checks for memory references outside of bounds with debug builds. When detected it shows 
some state and exits. Real RISC-V memory protection instructions are not implemented. For example:

    rvos fatal error: memory reference prior to address space: 200
    pc: 80000002 main
    address space 80000000 to 801105c0

Tracing with the -t and -i flags shows execution information including function names (if the RISC-V elf
image was built with symbols using -ggdb) and registers. For example, tcrash.elf is an app that makes 
an illegal access to memory. It was used for the crash dump above. Here is a simple crashing app tbad.c:

    int main()
    {
        char * pbad = (char *) 0x200;
        *pbad = 10;
    } //main

Here is the trace listing for tbad.c:
