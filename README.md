# rvos
Loads and runs Linux RISC-V .elf files on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

    usage: rvos <elf_executable>

    arguments:    -e     just show information about the elf executable; don't actually run it
                  -g     (internal) generate rcvtable.txt
                  -h:X   # of meg for the heap (brk space) 0..1024 are valid. default is 10
                  -i     if -t is set, also enables risc-v instruction tracing
                  -m:X   # of meg for mmap space 0..1024 are valid. default is 10
                  -p     shows performance information at app exit
                  -t     enable debug tracing to rvos.log

* Notes:
    * This is a simplistic 64-bit RISC-V M Mode emulator; it's an AEE (Application Execution Environment) that exposes a Linux-like ABI.
    * Only physical memory is supported.
    * Compressed rvc 16-bit instructions are supported, though apps run about 5% slower.
    * Single and double precision floating point instructions are implemented.
    * Atomic and fence instructions are implemented assuming there is just one core.
    * Much of the Gnu C Runtime is tested -- memory, fopen/open families of IO, date/time, printf/sprintf, math, etc.
    * No network system calls are implemented.
    * I also tested with the BASIC test suite for my compiler BA, which targets RISC-V.
    * The emulator is about as fast as the 400Mhz K210 physical processor when run on an AMD 5950x.
    * The tests folder has test apps written in C. These build with both old and recent g++ for RISC-V.
    * rvos has been built and tested on Windows (x86, amd64 and arm64), MacOS (arm64), and Linux (RISC-V, amd64, arm32, and arm64).
    * The emulator can run itself nested arbitrarily deeply. Perf is about 64x slower for each nesting.
    * Linux system call emulation isn't great. It's just good enough to test RISC-V emulation and run apps built with g++ and Rust.
    * Build for MacOS using mmac.sh or mrmac.sh (debug and release)
    * rvos only runs static-linked RISC-V .elf files. Use the -static flag with ld or the g++ command-line.
    * Gnu CC torture execution tests were run on the emulator.
    * The environment variable "OS=RVOS" is set for apps running in the emulator.
    * Tested with the 6502 / Apple 1 emulator in my ntvao repo built for RISC-V.
    * Tested with the Z80 / CP/M 2.2 emulator in my ntvcm repo built for RISC-V.
    * Tested with the 8086 / DOS emulator in my ntvdm repo built for RISC-V (for character-mode apps).
    * Tested with the Arm64 / Linux emulator in my ArmOS repo built for RISC-V.
    * Does not work with apps generated by Go, whose runtime apparently requires mmap to hand back requested addresses.
    * mmap calls work provided calls use flags ( MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS ). See tests\tmmap.c for an example. This is how clib uses mmap.
    * Works with Rust apps provided they're statically linked, e.g.: rustc -O -C target-feature=+crt-static sample.rs
    
* Files:
    * riscv.?xx       Emulates a RISC-V processor in M mode.
    * rvos.cxx        Loads .elf files and executes them using the riscv.?xx emulator. Emulates some Linux syscalls.
    * linuxem.h          Header file for rvos and for apps that call into rvos syscalls

    * m.bat           Builds rvos on Windows. mr.bat is the same but release-optimized
    * m.sh            Builds rvos on Linux. mr.sh is the same but is release-optimized.
    * mg.bat          Builds rvos on Windows using Mingw64 g++. mgr.bat for release-optimized.
    * mt.sh           Builds test .c apps on Linux

    * djl_mmap.hxx    very simplistic mmap implementation so the GNU C Runtime heap works
    * words.txt       Used by tests\an.c test app to generate anagrams 

The c_tests and rust_tests foldesr have a number of small C/C++/Rust programs to validate rvos. If the app will
use more 20 meg of RAM for the heap, use rvos' -h or -m argument to specify how much RAM to allocate. The anagram 
generater an can use up to 30MB in some cases.

I tested the apps above with 3 versions of g++ that target RISC-V. Generated apps from each utilize different RISC-V instructions and Linux syscalls.

    * Installed on Windows AMD64 on February 19, 2023 with Arduino with the SiPeed K210: riscv64-unknown-elf-g++.exe (GCC) 8.2.0
    * I cloned and built https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain on March 9, 2023 using Ubuntu AMD64: riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-c++ (g2ee5e430018) 12.2.0
    * Installed on Debian RISC-V September 3, 2023 using sudo apt-get install gpp: g++ (Debian 13.1.0-6) 13.1.0
    
To run the rvos emulator nested in the rvos emulator, on Linux/MacOS/Windows issue a command like:

    rvos -h:60 rvos.elf -h:40 an phoebe bridgers
    
That gives the inner emulator 60 megs of RAM so it can give 40 megs to the AN anagram generator (an.c in the 
tests folder) so it can find the 485 3-word anagrams for that text including bog bride herpes. Running the emulator
in the emulator makes it about 64x slower. Four Grammys and she deserved more.

The Gnu g++ compiler produces code that's about 10% faster than the Microsoft C++ compiler.

If you get a runtime error like this then use the -h or -m flags to reserve more RAM for the heap.

        terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
          what():  std::bad_alloc
          
RVOS has a few simple checks for memory references outside of bounds with debug builds. When detected it shows 
some state and exits. Real RISC-V memory protection instructions are not implemented. For example:

    rvos fatal error: memory reference prior to address space: 200
    pc: 80000002 main
    address space 80000000 to 801105c0

        tp:                0,   t0:                0,   t1:                0,   t2:                0,

        s4:                0,   s5:                0,   s6:                0,   s7:                0,

Tracing with the -t and -i flags shows execution information including function names (if the RISC-V elf
image was built with symbols using -ggdb) and registers. For example, tcrash.elf is an app that makes 
an illegal access to memory. It was used for the crash dump above. Here is a simple crashing app tbad.c:

    int main()
    {
        char * pbad = (char *) 0x200;
        *pbad = 10;
    } //main

Here is the trace listing for tbad.c using rvos -t -i tbad:
